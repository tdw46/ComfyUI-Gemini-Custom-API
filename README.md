## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Add the Node**: In ComfyUI, right-click and select `Add Node` > `image/generation` > `Gemini Image Generator üé®`

2. **Configure Parameters**:
   - **prompt**: Describe the image you want to generate
   - **model**: Choose between:
     - `gemini-2.5-flash-image` (default, stable version)
     - `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` (latest preview features)
   - **aspect_ratio**: Select from 1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 9:16, or 16:9
   - **response_modalities**: 
     - `Image` - Returns only the generated image
     - `Text and Image` - Returns both image and descriptive text
   - **api_key**: Your Google AI API key
   - **save_api_key**: Check to save API key for future sessions

3. **Generate**: Connect the output to a `SaveImage` node or any other image processing nodes

### Example Prompts

```
Create a serene mountain landscape at sunset with a lake reflection
```

```
A futuristic city with flying cars and neon lights, cyberpunk style
```

```
A cute cartoon robot playing with a puppy in a garden, colorful and cheerful
```

## API Key Security

- API keys are stored locally in `config.json` in the node directory
- The file is created automatically when you save an API key
- **Never share your config.json file or commit it to version control**
- A `.example` file is provided as a template

## Troubleshooting

### "API key is required" Error
- Make sure you've entered a valid Google AI API key
- Check that `save_api_key` is enabled
- Verify the key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)

### "No image was generated" Error
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your API key is still valid
- Try a different prompt or model
- Check the console for detailed error messages

### Import Errors
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Try updating the google-genai package: `pip install --upgrade google-genai`
- Restart ComfyUI after installing dependencies

### Image Not Appearing
- Check that the aspect ratio is compatible with your workflow
- Verify the node's outputs are connected properly
- Look for error messages in the ComfyUI console

## Best Practices

1. **Detailed Prompts**: More specific prompts generally produce better results
2. **Style Keywords**: Include style descriptors (realistic, cartoon, oil painting, etc.)
3. **Composition**: Specify layout, lighting, and mood
4. **Iteration**: Use the text response to refine your prompts
5. **API Limits**: Be mindful of API rate limits and quotas

## API Rate Limits

Google AI API has rate limits based on your account tier:
- Free tier: 60 requests per minute
- Check [Google AI pricing](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) for current limits

## Limitations

- Image generation does not support audio or video inputs
- The model may not always follow exact number specifications in prompts
- Works best with up to 3 reference images as input
- Best performance with languages: English, Spanish (Mexico), Japanese, Chinese, Hindi
- All generated images include a SynthID watermark for authenticity

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Image Generation
```
Prompt: "A magical forest with glowing mushrooms and fireflies at night"
Model: gemini-2.5-flash-image
Aspect Ratio: 16:9
Response: Image
```

### Example 2: With Text Description
```
Prompt: "An elegant modern kitchen with marble countertops"
Model: gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview
Aspect Ratio: 4:3
Response: Text and Image
```
